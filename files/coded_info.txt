Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to be the next technological revolution to change the way we work today. AI technology is designed to mimic human thinking by “learning” through recognizing patterns and drawing on past experiences. Today, AI technologies can identify objects, understand speech, translate languages, recognize faces, and analyze sentiments. Siri, Google Now, and IBM’s Watson are obvious examples of AI, but AI is all around us. It can be found in vacuum cleaners, cars, lawnmowers, video games, medical research, and international financial markets. In recent years scientists made breakthroughs in AI, using neural networks, which mimic the processes of real neurons. On the other hand, the volume of data is expected to grow to 35 trillion Gigabytes in 2020 as compared to 0.5 trillion Gigabytes in 2009 i.e., by a factor of 44. World Economic Forum in 2011 declared that “Data is the new Oil.” Today, deep learning allows machines to process information for themselves on a very sophisticated level enabling them to perform complex functions like facial recognition and next-generation genome sequencing.

The College of Computer Science and Information Technology (CCSIT) understands that it is time to create adequate knowledge in the field of AI for the socio-economic uplift of the region. With a pool of talented faculty, CCSIT initiated an undergraduate degree in AI, offered under the umbrella of the Computer Engineering (CE) Department at CCSIT.
